Hello Community!

I need to implement an upload functionality to load an image into an offline PDF file (NO server upload - the image should be stored in the PDF file). Is there an adequate upload functionality available in SAP Adobe Interactive Forms (using LiveCycle Designer ES)?

Greetings,

Johannes
